# Multiplayer (Link Play) — experimental

Pokopia's **Link Play** (local wireless, several players on one island) between PCs, Steam Decks and other handhelds. This port speaks
pokopia-native's co-op protocol, so you can also play with **pokopia-native** players.

## Before you start

- **Cross-play** works with pokopia-native players on game version **2.0.1**. Players on 1.0.5 cannot join (the game builds differ).
- **Not compatible with earlier Link Play builds of this port** (the old relay on port 39660). Everyone needs a build with this protocol.
- **Each player needs their own save.** The host refuses a visitor whose save it already has (error 9005, "Communication error"):
  two copies of one save cannot play together. Earlier builds gave every new save the same player id, so every visit failed with
  9005; the game now repairs such a save by itself at start (a copy is kept in `uuid-backup\` in the save folder).
- Every player needs the same **Interact everywhere** and **Story co-op** settings, or the host is not listed. Only the host's save keeps story progress.

## Setting it up

Use the launcher's **Link Play** page. It writes the `[net]` and `[pkp]` keys in `pkp.ini` for you; changes apply the next time the game
starts. Then in the game: the PC in your first house -> Link Play (unlocked after Environment Level 2 in Withered Wasteland) -> **Local
connection**. One player picks **Invite Others to Visit**, the others **Visit a Friend**.

| Choice | What it does |
|---|---|
| Alone | No Link Play. |
| Automatic (LAN) | The default. On the same Wi-Fi or network: the host is found by itself. |
| Visit by address | Join one host by its address (shown on the host's Link Play page). Use this when the host is not found. |
| Internet | Host or visit through a relay with a room code. The host's page shows the code; visitors type the relay address and the code. |

Options: **Interact everywhere** (visitors can use moves and items and build in the story areas too, not only in Palette Town) and **Story
co-op** (visitors can talk to the story characters; turns on Interact everywhere). Both are experimental.

**Steam Deck and other Proton/Linux devices** find hosts and are found the same way. Proton has no DNS-SD, so there the game sweeps
its own network for hosts on port 47600 each time it scans, and a hosting device answers DNS-SD (mDNS) queries itself, so Windows players
see it too. Nothing to type, and nothing to change when you take the device to another network. `[net] lan_sweep = off` turns this off.

What it cannot get past:
- **Wi-Fi that keeps devices apart** (many cafes, hotels and guest networks: "client isolation"). Nobody on it can reach anybody. Use
  **Internet** with a relay and a room code instead.
- **A host on another port.** When 47600 is taken on the host (a second copy of the game), it listens on a port the system picks, and the
  sweep does not find it. Visit it by address with the port from its log.

## Invites and Tailscale

Instead of typing an address and a room code, the host can **copy an invite** and the friends **paste** it.

- **Host:** on the launcher's Link Play page, press **Copy invite** beside an address (a same-network address, a Tailscale address, the
  public address, or a relay). For Tailscale or the internet the invite includes the room code, so the host needs one: **New code**, or
  start the game as host. Send the whole message to your friends in any chat.
- **Friend:** open the Link Play page and paste the message into **Paste invite**. The launcher fills in the address and the room code and
  picks the right mode (Same network, or Internet with Visit), then the usual steps in the game apply.
- **Tailscale:** the game counts Tailscale's addresses (100.64.0.0/10) as internet play, so every player needs internet play and the
  host's room code. The invite does this for you: on the host's Internet page, with **Through a relay** off, the page lists the host's
  Tailscale address; **Copy invite** next to it, and the friends paste. Tailscale has no automatic discovery in the game (the LAN sweep
  skips VPN adapters), so the address always travels in the invite.
- An invite is plain text and carries the room code: share it only with the people you want to play with.

Three read-only helpers on the same page (they change nothing on your PC):

- **Test connection** (Visit and Same network): tries to reach the address you typed and says what happened in words: reached,
  the PC answered but no game is hosting yet, no answer (a firewall may block the port, or it is on another network), or not an address.
- **Check my setup:** looks at this PC's addresses, the Windows network profile and, on Linux, what the firewall says, and lists what may
  stop friends from joining, with a short fix for each. It never changes a firewall or network setting.
- **Friends on my Tailscale** (Visit): if Tailscale is installed, lists your devices and which of them are hosting right now; **Join**
  fills in that device's address, then paste the host's invite (or type the room code) to finish.

## Ports and firewall

| Port | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| 47600 TCP + UDP | the host | Visitors connect here (LAN, or the internet without a relay). |
| 47610 TCP (+ UDP) | the relay | Internet play through a relay. UDP is optional, see below. |

- The first time you host, Windows Firewall may ask about pkp.exe: allow it on **private** networks. If nobody finds you, check that your
  network is set to Private (Settings, Network & internet, your connection, Network profile type) and that pkp.exe is allowed.
- **Internet without a relay:** the host's router must forward TCP and UDP 47600 to the host. While it hosts, the game asks the router
  for that itself (UPnP, NAT-PMP or PCP; `[net] port_forward`, on by default, and **Ask the router to open the port** on the launcher's Host
  view) and gives the port back when hosting ends. When the router does not allow it, or the internet provider shares one address among
  many homes (carrier-grade NAT), `pkp.log` says so in a `nat:` line: forward the port by hand, or use a relay or a VPN. Visitors pick
  Visit by address with the host's public address and enter the host's room code.
- **Internet through a relay:** nobody forwards anything except whoever runs the relay. Any pokopia-native coop relay works. The launcher can
  run one too: **Run a relay here** on the Link Play page (while the launcher stays open), or `PokopiaLauncher --host` on a server
  (`--listen <IPv4>[:<port>]`, `--no-udp`, and pokopia-native's limits options). Forward TCP 47610 to it, and UDP 47610 too for the faster path.

With the launcher's relay and this port's build on both ends of a link, the game's packets go over UDP through the relay instead of the TCP
link, which avoids stalls on lossy connections. With pokopia-native's relay, or a pokopia-native player on the other end, they use the TCP
link as pokopia-native does. Either way they are checked end to end with the room code: the relay only forwards them. Nothing is encrypted.

## Old protocol

The launcher's Link Play page keeps the old protocol under **Advanced** (`[net] protocol = linkplay`), for a session where everyone still
has an earlier build of this port. It cannot meet pokopia-native players.

## Common problems

- **The host is not found:** pick **Visit by address** and type the host's address. Check the firewall prompt and the Private network profile.
  On cafe or hotel Wi-Fi that keeps devices apart, nothing on the LAN works: use **Internet** with a relay.
- **Refused:** version or mods mismatch. Same game (2.0.1), same release or pokopia-native, same two switches.
- **Error 9005:** both players have the same player id: two copies of one save, or a player still on an earlier build (every save made
  before had the same id). Update both; a copied save still needs a new game.

## Status

Joining and walking around together work. Not yet tested: long sessions, more than two players, leaving and rejoining, play over the
internet. Expect bugs; report them with every player's `pkp.log`.
