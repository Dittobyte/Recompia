// SPIR-V rewrites the back end applies to the translated shaders when it builds a pipeline (render thread). The offline translator
// knows one shader at a time; the console's rules are looser than Vulkan's about what the stages of a pipeline have to agree on.
//
//   spirv_add_outputs   a fragment shader reads varyings (or an indexed array of them) that the stage before it never declared. The
//                       console hands it undefined values; Vulkan wants an output in every slot (VUID-RuntimeSpirv-OpEntryPoint-08743).
//                       The producer gets unwritten outputs there.
//   spirv_dual_source_output
//                       a fragment shader of a draw with dual-source blending: the console takes the second blend source from render
//                       target 1's output; Vulkan from the output at Location 0, Index 1 (and allows a single such attachment).
//
//   spirv_add_xfb      a vertex shader that runs with transform feedback: the Location outputs are captured into buffer 0 in Location
//                       order, each narrowed to the components the shader stores (a vec4 whose xyz are written is captured as 12
//                       bytes), tightly packed. The console's layout lives in the driver's compile data; this is the layout the
//                       game's stream-out shaders use (docs/S4e.md).
//
//   spirv_init_outputs  a vertex, tessellation evaluation or geometry shader that writes only some components of a Location output (the
//                       sky dome's vertex shader stores .w of one vec4 and .xyz of others) while the next stage reads all four. The
//                       console (and Ryujinx) start every user output at (0,0,0,1); in Vulkan an unwritten component is undefined: AMD's
//                       Windows driver happens to hand 0, Mesa RADV hands garbage (a NaN that blacks out the HDR frame). The entry point
//                       now stores (0,0,0,1) to every Location output first, and a geometry shader again after each emitted vertex.
//
//   spirv_base_instance_from_c0
//                       a vertex shader that adds NVN's base instance word c[0] + 0x644 to the instance ID (GLSLC's instance
//                       index; the translation reads `gl_InstanceIndex - gl_BaseInstance + c0[100].y`). The word is the draw's
//                       base instance, which for an indirect draw lives in the arguments the GPU may write (and a multi-draw has
//                       one per draw). Each load of c0[100].y becomes a load of the BaseInstance built-in, which Vulkan takes from
//                       the draw itself, direct or indirect.
//
//   spirv_ballot_per_lane
//                       a compute shader's warp-aggregated atomic counter (ballot(true), the highest lane leads, adds the bit count
//                       for all, hands each lane its slot by a shuffle plus its rank) can stop NVIDIA GPUs for good after some lanes
//                       returned (device lost). Each such ballot becomes the lane's own bit: every lane leads itself and adds 1.
//                       Approach from pokopia-native (MIT) windows/docs/ballot-hang.md, vk_shader.c @4a72d23; the matcher is ours.
//
//   spirv_limit_count   a compute shader whose loop runs to a count read from a constant buffer word and walks the items of a texel buffer
//                       table. A count that is not the game's (a stale or garbage word) runs the loop for seconds and NVIDIA's driver
//                       drops the device (pokopia-native D-1, D-11). The count, where it is compared, becomes min(count, the items the
//                       table holds), or min(count, 16384). Ported from pokopia-native (MIT) vk_shader.c vkspv_limit_count @9cb7f07.
//
// The idea (pattern-matching on the module's declarations, new ids from the bound) follows SuperMarioWonderRecomp's
// nvn_spirv_patch.cpp (MIT); the code is new.
