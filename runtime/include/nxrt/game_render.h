// and the extras read it once, the first time they need it, so it costs the per-draw paths a compare against a cached value at most.
// Every part is optional. A null part turns off what needs it:
//   readback_defer   none: [nvn] readback_defer never defers a read
//   camera           none: no temporal upscaling (FSR 3 / DLSS / DLAA find no camera, nothing is jittered)
//   tonemaps         none: no shader is the tone map (no HDR variant, no scene upscaler, no temporal pass)
//   loop_guards      none: no compute loop gets its count limited ([nvn] loop_guard has nothing to do)
// Header-only and free of Vulkan, so game.h users that do not link the graphics back end can include it.
