// Pokémon Pokopia: our entries in the game's key guide (pkp_key_guide.cpp). The title's Quit Game (pkp_title.cpp), the bag's Hold to
// Sort click (pkp_sort.cpp) and the crafting screen's Search (pkp_craft.cpp) are clients: each says what it wants done when the widget takes a set,
// lays its entries out and fills a part, and what a click on its part does. This module owns the widget's hooks, its layout facts, the
// writes into a part (icon, text) and the routing of a click on a client's part (pkp_menu.cpp).
//
// The widget (one per player, manager [0x3483fb8], ctor 0x7100ec4958): 0x7100ec5de0 (widget, set) gives it a key guide set, a row of the
// data table +0x1048 holding up to six key guide ids (u16, 1..399). Each id is a row of the table +0x1050: {u16 action, ff, 00, u8 text,
// 7f, ..} (the action picks the button icon, the text byte an entry of the key guide text bank). Its layout pass 0x7100ec54a0 (widget)
// places one instance of the key guide part (layout 881468973) per entry (+0xb0 entries of 0x360 bytes, +0xb8 count; six part slots) and
// fills each through 0x7100ec6800, whose end (inline 0x7100ec69b4) is where a client edits the part.
